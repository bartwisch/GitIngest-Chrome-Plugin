create a chrome plugin that only works on a github repository page

if the user clicks on "ingest", the plugin opens the repository url but replaces "github" to "gitingest".

example: user is on the repository page 
https://github.com/bartwisch/MCPRules

then the plugin will open the following url:
https://gitingest.com/bartwisch/MCPRules
